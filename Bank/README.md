BitPoints Bank (Playground3)
------

A currency and bank system developed by Seth J Nielson for the Johns Hopkins University's Network Security course(s). Updated for use with Python3 and Playground3.

Depends on Playground3 and Python 3.5+.

After starting a Switch and VNIC, use ./test.sh to run a fairly comprehensive set of tests which will generate a new bank, print some money, and start a bank server with some users and accounts (you'll need to input some passwords along the way). You'll need to start a client on your own (see bottom of test.sh) to test that aspect.

There are some configurations inside OnlineBank.py that you might need to change yourself (namely, the default bank address).
